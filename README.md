How Many Unis:

Unfortunatley Github does not offer php support on its website, and this application uses php to do its thing.
So for now ill leave you with a delightful description of what it does:
  This website uses a free Rick and Morty api. 
  It selects a random charcter from teh beloved show, and then displays the chracters name and image, with a few randmoly generated stats. 
  The website tells you which rick and morty chracter you will be fighting
  If you are unhappy with your given oponent, you are able to regenerate your oppenent

That is all from me for today, sorry your cant view this website, but i hope you enjoyed the ted talk : )
